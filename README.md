# Vitos-Barbershop
 Static page for demo of Vitos barbershop

**Project Notes**
The process went as most static websites. I created everything having to do with the information using the HTML. Then, after having all the pages to the site completed using HTML. I started styling the website using CSS. I decided to include Bootstrap to make the responsive a bit quicker and easier to work with. As for the book appointments, I wasn't able to figure an API to connect. Being that it was a demo. I did not want to spend too much time looking for it. So, I was able to link his booking information to the book button.

 * Completed the index.html, contact.html, and the gallery.html.
 * Need to make the site responsive, add the script for the contact form. get the event booking api and the payment method.
